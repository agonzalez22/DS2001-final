DS2001-final
For our research project we plan on addressing the question of “What is the safest mode of transportation in each neighborhood of Boston?”.  First, we will utilize the .csv file to sort through locations of collisions and accidents. We can then analyze specific streets and districts in Boston that have high collision/accident counts. From there, it would be in our best interest to determine which areas have higher counts of collisions/accidents where specific modes of transportation are involved. For example, we could analyze and examine the neighborhood with the most Tram accidents, or the streets with the most bicycle collisions. We should also be able to determine and visualize the severity of these accidents, as the data sets we are working with provide such information. 

In addition, we would divide the data into quarters based on the month of the accident. From there we can ascertain the safest part of the year to use any mode of transportation depending on the frequency of the accident. 

Ultimately we should be able to manipulate the data in a way where we can properly determine what mode(s) of transportation  would be safest in specific neighborhoods of Boston.
